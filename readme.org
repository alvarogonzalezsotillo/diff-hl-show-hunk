# file:https://melpa.org/packages/diff-hl-show-hunk-badge.svg]]

This emacs package shows a [[https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el][popup]] or a [[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]] with the current hunk diff in a buffer under version control. It is based on [[https://github.com/dgutov/diff-hl][diff-hl]].




* Standalone installation

Add this repository to your =load-path=, require it, and enable it for each buffer with =alt-x= =diff-hl-show-hunk-mode=. A global mode =global-diff-hl-show-hunk-mode= is also available.

You can add a hook to enable it when oppening a buffer, as in the code below.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'diff-hl-show-hunk)
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'diff-hl-show-hunk-mode)
#+end_src

** Installation from MELPA
This package is (not yet) available on Melpa.

It will be installable with =use-package=
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package diff-hl-show-hunk
  :ensure t
  :config
  (face-spec-set 'diff-hl-show-hunk-face
                 '((t :background "darkblue") (:height 0.8)))
  (setq diff-hl-show-hunk-internal-border-color "blue")
  (global-diff-hl-show-hunk-mode))
#+end_src



* If it gets integrated in =diff-hl=

The current modified hunk is shown with =M-x= =diff-hl-show-hunk=. If =diff-hl-show-hunk-mode= is enabled, the hunk can be invoked with =C-x v += or clicking in fringe or The current modified hunk is shown with =M-x= =diff-hl-show-hunk=. If =diff-hl-show-hunk-mode= is enabled, the hunk can be invoked with =C-x v *= or clicking in fringe or margin.
** Customization  
- =diff-hl-show-hunk-narrow=: If =t= (default) the contents of the posframe are narrowed to the current hunk.
- =diff-hl-show-hunk-clicked-line-face=: The face used to highlight the corresponding line of the clicked line. Defaults to inverse video.
- =diff-hl-show-hunk-face=: The face used in the hunk buffer (only used in posframe backend). Defaults to default face with size =0.8=

  The actual backend is specified in =diff-hl-show-hunk-function=. It should be a function that receives as parameters a buffer and a line number. The buffer contains the hunk, and the line corresponds with the line in the original buffer. The default function is =diff-hl-show-hunk-function-default=, that tries to use =diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe= (in GUI) or =diff-hl-show-hunk-popup= (in TUI)
  
** Posframe backend

It is implemented in =diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe= function. A child frame ([[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe][posframe]]) is shown with the current hunk.
- The hunk can be scrolled standard commands (cursors, mouse wheel...)
- Regions can be selected and killed, since the posframe get the focus.
- The frame can be resized by dragging the borders.
- To close the frame, click outside it or press =q=.
- Press =n= to go to the next hunk/change, or =p= to go to previous hunk/change.

The appearance of the frame can be customized:
- =diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe-show-head-line=: if =t=, the frame shows some useful buttons as a title bar. The title bar allows to move the posframe if dragged.
- There are some options (matching the parameters of [[https://github.com/tumashu/posframe/blob/7b92a54e588889a74d36d51167e067676db7be8a/posframe.el#L372][ =posframe-show= ]] function):
    - =diff-hl-show-hunk-internal-border-width=: Width of the internal border.
    - =diff-hl-show-hunk-internal-border-color=: Color of the internal border.
    - =diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe-poshandler=: =poshandler= to control de position of the frame (see =posframe-show= function)
    - =diff-hl-show-hunk-posframe-parameters=: Aditional parameters for the frame creation (see =posframe-show= function)

** Popup backend
It is implementd in =diff-hl-show-hunk-popup= function. A [[https://github.com/auto-complete/popup-el][popup]] is shown with the current hunk.
- The popup can be scrolled with standard commands (cursors, mouse wheel, =C-p=, =M-v=,... )
- The popup is closed by any other command
- The default width and height are customized by =diff-hl-show-hunk-popup-default-width=  and =diff-hl-show-hunk-popup-default-height=.
- The actual width and height are computed by the functions defined in =diff-hl-show-hunk-popup-width-function= and =diff-hl-show-hunk-popup-height-function=.
